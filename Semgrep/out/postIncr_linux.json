Increase the amount of memory available to semgrep\n                    2. Reduce the number of jobs semgrep runs with via `-j <jobs>`. We\n                        recommend using 1 job if you are running out of memory.\n                    3. Scan the repo in parts (contact us for help)\n\n                    Otherwise, it is likely that semgrep is hitting the limit on only some\n                    files. In this case, you can try to set the limit on the amount of memory\n                    semgrep can use on each file with `--max-memory <memory>`. We recommend\n                    lowering this to a limit 70% of the available memory. For CI runs with\n                    interfile analysis, the default max-memory is 5000MB. Without, the default\n                    is unlimited.\n\n                    The last thing you can try if none of these work is to raise the stack\n                    limit with `ulimit -s <limit>`.\n\n                    If you have tried all these steps and still are seeing this error, please\n                    contact us.\n\n                       Error: semgrep-core exited with unexpected output\n                    ", "type": "SemgrepError"}], "paths": {"_comment": "<add --verbose for a list of skipped paths>", "scanned": []}, "results": [], "version": "1.25.0"}
